# CV GPT Bot

This is a basic Python Flask implementation of OpenAI's Assistants API, allowing you to create an assistant that can use your CV as a knowledgebase to give others information about yourself, your experience, your skills and more.

### Slight Disclaimer

If you do choose to use this to try and advertise your CV, I would recommend you keep the disclaimer message. It took some tweaking in OpenAI's bot settings to stop it from blatantly lying about me studying at The University of Manchester, and even so, I'm pretty sure it has the ability to lie about other things despite my bot instructions explicitly stating to not infer or lie about things!
